# 🏠 House Price Prediction

## 📖 About the Project
This project predicts house prices based on various features such as location, size, number of rooms, and amenities using **Machine Learning regression models**.  
The workflow covers **data preprocessing**, **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, **feature engineering**, **model training**, and **evaluation**.  
Developed and executed in **Google Colab** for easy accessibility without requiring a local setup.
